## Consuming Library Documentation
**Note: All work is experimental and we understand some benchmarks might not be the most optimal.**

This C# nuget package is dependent on our Rust layer that contains methods to run industry standard cryptographic operations sequentially, on threads, and the thread pool [cas-core-lib](https://github.com/Crytographic-API-Services/cas-core-lib).
This requires an install of the Rust programming language. You can find instructions to do that [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
